p<>. *Title: Knowledge-based environmental research infrastructure with semantic web technologies*

p<>. _The talk aims at underscoring potential roles of semantic web technologies in environmental science, in particular for environmental research infrastructures that build on sensor networks. Compared to bioinformatics, where semantic web technologies have long found application in well-known projects, the adoption of the technologies in environmental science is arguably less prominent--despite having similar potential. We will discuss examples for how semantic web technologies are utilized in environmental science and focus on their potential role in software infrastructure for environmental research that relies on data acquired from sensor networks. To unleash the potential, researchers and developers in knowledge engineering and semantic web and earth and environmental scientists are encouraged to continue seeking interdisciplinary dialogue and further solidify collaboration_.

p<>. Markus is a researcher at the University of Eastern Finland where he is working at the intersection of semantic technologies and environmental sciences.
He is well known in the Semantic Web community for his pioneering work on SPARQL query optimization using selectivity estimations for Basic Graph Patterns. 
Previously he was a member of "HP Labs":http://www.hpl.hp.com/bristol/ in Bristol, UK, "Clark & Parsia":http://complexible.com, in Washington DC, as well as the University of Zurich, Switzerland.

p<>. *Title: Machine readable semantic data right from content owner is a beautiful thing for semantic web world*

p<>. _But we don't live in the world with unicorns. And not all semantic data from content owners is good. There are some problem with it. Problem number zero - completeness. First problem is homonymy. Second one is incorrect data. It can appear two ways: because of webmasters and because of webmasters. Sometimes people just make mistakes because of they are people. Not to smart, not to careful, unlike robots. Sometimes they make a mistake because they hope to get something useful for themselves with those mistakes. They just try to hack the system._

p<>. _When we solve all this problem beautiful feature becomes. User will be able to search not by world, but by meaning. And they will find all pages with appropriate meaning. All internet will become a collection of objects connected to each other._

p<>. Yuliya is a project manager at Yandex in Moscow. Her research interests focus upon the practical application of semantic technologies in the modern Internet. As a part of the working group she participates in the development of schema.org. Yuliya got master's degree in Higher School of Economics, Moscow. Her master thesis was concerned with the unification of linguistic and semantic web technologies.

p<>. *Title: What WoT means for the Web*

!{width: 200px; float: left; margin: 10px;}/resources/erik.wilde.jpg!

p<>. _Looking back at the Internet, arguably the biggest impact on how the Internet evolved and developed was the invention of the Web. It can be argued that the nascent Internet of Things (IoT) might take the same trajectory, with first seeing limited and isolated success in specific domains, and then taking off exponentially once those limitations are removed by  making the step from IoT to the Web of Things (WoT). This speculative talk is exploring the ways in which IoT and the Web may change once WoT becomes a reality. Big Data's 4V (volume, velocity, variety, and variability) provide good starting points to explore the ways in which the WoT Web may have to evolve in the IoT age._

p<>. Erik is working on Web Technologies, Web Architecture, and Service Architecture, recently focusing on the Internet of Things and how it can be used as the foundation for the emerging Web of Things. His long standing interest is in structured data in decentralized scenarios. Focusing on Hypermedia, he's specifically interested in the connective fabric that allows services and applications to interact and evolve with as little coupling as possible. Working in academia for most of his life, Erik has held jobs in industry for the past three years, but still remains active in standardization activities (IETF and W3C) and various conferences.
