p<>. *Title: Knowledge-based environmental research infrastructure with semantic web technologies*

p<>. _The talk aims at underscoring potential roles of semantic web technologies in environmental science, in particular for environmental research infrastructures that build on sensor networks. Compared to bioinformatics, where semantic web technologies have long found application in well-known projects, the adoption of the technologies in environmental science is arguably less prominent--despite having similar potential. We will discuss examples for how semantic web technologies are utilized in environmental science and focus on their potential role in software infrastructure for environmental research that relies on data acquired from sensor networks. To unleash the potential, researchers and developers in knowledge engineering and semantic web and earth and environmental scientists are encouraged to continue seeking interdisciplinary dialogue and further solidify collaboration_.

h3. *"Erik Wilde":http://dret.net/netdret/*, Web of Things, Siemens Berkeley, USA

p<>. *Title: TBD*

p<>. Abstract: TBD

!{width: 200px; float: left; margin: 10px;}/resources/erik.wilde.jpg!

p<>. Erik is working on Web Technologies, Web Architecture, and Service Architecture, recently focusing on the Internet of Things and how it can be used as the foundation for the emerging Web of Things. His long standing interest is in structured data in decentralized scenarios. Focusing on Hypermedia, he's specifically interested in the connective fabric that allows services and applications to interact and evolve with as little coupling as possible. Working in academia for most of his life, Erik has held jobs in industry for the past three years, but still remains active in standardization activities (IETF and W3C) and various conferences.
